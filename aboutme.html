    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br />
    <p>This is a page about me and who I am.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Hi, I'm Thomas, also known as Thomasluigi07 and Thomas07.</p>
    <p>I'm a furry, which also makes me cringe instantly (lol)</p>
    <p>I like coding things and making shitty youtube videos.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I'm 16 years old, Bisexual (my pronouns are he/him), and from Australia. I have been diagnosed with Autism and ADHD.</p>
    <p>I am obsessed with Skeuomorphic design, WALL-E, Rayman, Klonoa, Luigi, iOS 6, the Wii U, 3DS and XBOX 360, and lots of other stuff that I haven't mentioned here.</p>
    <p>I started coding with Scratch when I was 8, and also started making Roblox games around that time as well.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I've decided to move on from Roblox related stuff now, as I felt that has caused too much stress for me. I'll still be playing it from time to time, though.</p>
    <!--
    I swear if people comment on my group's group wall one more time about "OHHH I WANT WINDOWS 95 SIMULATOR PLS WORK ON THAT" I'm going to fucking [ Content Deleted ].
    -->
    <p>Anyways, that's all from me. Sorry if this was a big read, but yeah. That's me, and me, and me, and me.</p>
