        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>This is a page about me. Wow!</h3>
        <br />
        <p>I'm Thomas, aka Thomasluigi07.</p>
        <p>I like coding things and making shitty bootleg(fangames) copies of operating systems and games.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>I'm 17 years old, Bisexual (he/him), a furry (WTF!), and from Australia. I'm diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. Wow!.</p>
        <p>I am obsessed with Skeuomorphic design, WALL-E, Rayman, Klonoa, Luigi, iOS 6, the Wii U, 3DS and XBOX 360, and lots of other stuff that I haven't mentioned here. The list is too long. Send help.</p>
        <p>I collect consoles and games. The most games I own for a console so far is the Wii U. Because of course it has to be the Wii U.</p>
        <p>I started coding with Scratch when I was 8, and also started making Roblox games around that time as well.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Congratulation(s). You have now learnt about me. Wow! But what shall you do with this information you have gained?</p>
        <p>I'm keeping an eye on you, buddy. (This is a joke, however, the Wise Mystical Tree knows what you're viewing. He even knows what I'm viewing. This is a cry for hel-)</p>
