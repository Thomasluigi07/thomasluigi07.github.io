                <h3>KLONOA: Door To Phantomile (PS1)</h3>
                <h4>NAMCO</h4> <!-- do not kill klonoa please -->
                <p>Klonoa is one of the best platformers I've ever played. It looks really good, controls are very fluid, music so good that I have every single track in the ost in my playlist. Oh my god, this game is awesome. In Klonoa, you play as Klonoa and you do Klonoa things and get to the end of the level. Sounds simple, right? WRONG! This game is 2.5D!!!!! WOAH!! IT'S 3D AND 2D!!! THAT'S CRAZY!!! This game is just... I can't explain it. Play it. Play it. Play it.</p>

                <h3>RAYMAN (PS1)</h3>
                <h4>Ubi Soft</h4> <!-- please make rayman 4 -->
                <p>RAYMAN is a very difficult, but very beautiful game. The first few levels are very easy, but as soon as you unlock Band Land, get ready to die... and die... and die. You will game over A LOT. This game literally kicks you in the balls when you don't expect it. Also this game also has a kick-ass soundtrack. Rayman controls very well.</p>

                <h3>PERFECT DARK (N64)</h3> <!-- perfect dark is forever -->
                <h4>Rare</h4> <!-- designs the future-->
                <p>As a spiritual successor to goldeneye, this game really pushes the N64 to it's god damn limits. There is so much content and modes it's overwhelming (in a good way)! There's the solo missions, co-op missions, combat simulator (deathmatch mode), COUNTER-op missions (where your 2P is the enemy, why isnt this in more games), lots of cheats and more. There's so many graphical effects which makes me question how even is this running on a N64. However, there's one thing that can make this hard to play for some people. Framerate. This game can slow down A LOT in some areas, bringing the game down to a measly 9FPS sometimes! However, you could just play the Xbox 360 version to mitigate that. And of course, the awesome soundtrack. And also there's FUCKING FULL ON CUTSCENES WITH VOICES!??!?!? HOW IS THIS GAME BELOW 32 MB!??</p>

                <h3>PIKMIN 3 (Wii U)</h3>
                <h4>Nintendo</h4>
                <p>Pikmin 3 is one of my most favorite games on the Wii U. I love how the Gamepad is handled, the story is great and I had lots of fun collecting all of the fruit. Beautiful looking water. Not much else to say, play it NOW!!!</p>

                <h3>WALL-E (Xbox 360/PS3/Wii)</h3>
                <h4>Heavy Iron Studios</h4>
                <p>WALL-E is an okay game. My favorite level is the one where WALL-E steals EVE's gun for no reason and absolutley destroys 100+ Stewards for no reason. Multiplayer mode also has a mode where multiple WALL-E units battle it out with EVE's gun in a deathmatch fashion. It's fun. However, this game can be pretty buggy at times (especially the Wii version), and boring too, as some parts of the can be repetitive.</p>

                <h3>SONIC CD (Mega CD)</h3>
                <h4>SEGA</h4>
                <p>Sonic CD is Sonic's first (and only) game on the Mega CD. You have to save Little Planet from being taken over by Dr Eggman by travelling into the past, which I think is a pretty cool concept. It's just your average "Classic Sonic" game. I like the level design and overall it's fun. I also really like the "Mode-7" special stages.</p>

                <h5 style="margin-bottom: 3px;">Puyo Puyo Tetris (Wii U)</h5>
                <h4>SEGA</h4>
                <p>Puyo Puyo Tetris is a game that has Puyo Puyo and Tetris (no shit). It's done so well that it feels as if these puzzle games were made for eachother. There's multiple modes and they're all fun (except party mode, what the hell is that shit???) The story mode is okay, however some people can find the voices annoying. The Wii U version only released in Japan, so you will need a Japanese Wii U or a softmodded Wii U to play the game... or you could just get it on another platform like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PS4 and PC.</p>

                <h4>Nintendo</h4>
                <p>Mario Kart Wii is a mario kart game for the Wii. This game is very unbalanced, and the online is still full of Funky Kongs (Please Stop). However, that doesn't matter because this game is hella fun to play, especially with friends and family! The battle mode is also great too, i wish more people played it online though. Stop playing Countdown Mode, you CTGP fuckers.</p>

                <h3>The Lego Movie Videogame (3DS)</h3>
                <h4>WB GAMES</h4>
                <p>The Lego Movie Videogame for the 3DS is a weird game. Instead of being a regular Travelers Tales Lego game, it's completly different, where you literally cannot jump. What the fuck bro. Why DOESNT my lego man JUMP!??!?!? Anyways, you only have 1 life on a level. If you die, you have to restart the level, which SUCKS. This game was really unforgiving for young me and now it made me hate it so since I'm biased... You get the idea.</p>
