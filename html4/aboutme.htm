        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>This is a page about me and who I am.</h3>
        <br />
        <p>Hi, I'm Thomas, also known as Thomasluigi07 and Thomas07.</p>
        <p>I'm a furry, which also makes me cringe instantly (lol)</p>
        <p>I like coding things and making shitty youtube videos.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I'm 17 years old, Bisexual (my pronouns are he/him), and from Australia. I have been diagnosed with Autism and ADHD.</p>
        <p>I am obsessed with Skeuomorphic design, WALL-E, Rayman, Klonoa, Luigi, iOS 6, the Wii U, 3DS and XBOX 360, and lots of other stuff that I haven't mentioned here.</p>
        <p>I started coding with Scratch when I was 8, and also started making Roblox games around that time as well.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Anyways, that's all from me. Sorry if this was a big read, but yeah. That's me, and me, and me, and me.</p>
