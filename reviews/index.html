                        <p>Klonoa is one of the best platformers I've ever played. It looks really good, controls are very fluid, music so good that I have every single track in the ost in my playlist. Oh my god, this game is awesome. In Klonoa, you play as Klonoa and you do Klonoa things and get to the end of the level. Sounds simple, right? WRONG! This game is 2.5D!!!!! WOAH!! IT'S 3D AND 2D!!! THAT'S CRAZY!!! This game is just... I can't explain it. Play it. Play it. Play it.</p>

                        <p>RAYMAN is a very difficult, but very beautiful game. The first few levels are very easy, but as soon as you unlock Band Land, get ready to die... and die... and die. You will game over A LOT. This game literally kicks you in the balls when you don't expect it. Also this game also has a kick-ass soundtrack. Rayman controls very well.</p>

                        <h4>Rare</h4>
                        <p>As a spiritual successor to goldeneye, this game really pushes the N64 to it's god damn limits. There is so much content and modes it's overwhelming (in a good way)! There's the solo missions, co-op missions, combat simulator (deathmatch mode), COUNTER-op missions (where your 2P is the enemy, why isnt this in more games), lots of cheats and more. There's so many graphical effects which makes me question how even is this running on a N64. However, there's one thing that can make this hard to play for some people. Framerate. This game can slow down A LOT in some areas, bringing the game down to a measly 9FPS sometimes! However, you could just play the Xbox 360 version to mitigate that. And of course, the awesome soundtrack. And also there's FUCKING FULL ON CUTSCENES WITH VOICES!??!?!? HOW IS THIS GAME BELOW 32 MB!??</p>

                        <p>WALL-E is an okay game. My favorite level is the one where WALL-E steals EVE's gun for no reason and absolutley destroys 100+ Stewards for no reason. Multiplayer mode also has a mode where multiple WALL-E units battle it out with EVE's gun in a deathmatch fashion. It's fun. However, this game can be pretty buggy at times (especially the Wii version), and boring too, as some parts of the can be repetitive. Not much replay factor, too.</p>

                        <p>Jokes aside, this is an okay puzzle game. It reminds me of something else, but I can't put my finger on it... It sucks that you can't offset incoming beans. You can be instantly killed by your opponent if they make a big chain.</p>

                        <p>Sonic CD is Sonic's first (and only) game on the Mega CD. You have to save Little Planet from being taken over by Dr Eggman by travelling into the past, which I think is a pretty cool concept. It's just your average "Classic Sonic" game. I like the level design and overall it's fun. I also really like the "Mode-7" special stages.</p>

                        <h4>SEGA</h4>
                        <p>Puyo Puyo Tetris is a game that has Puyo Puyo and Tetris (no shit). It's done so well that it feels as if these puzzle games were made for eachother. There's multiple modes and they're all fun (except party mode, what the hell is that shit???) The story mode is okay, however some people can find the voices annoying. Pro tip: Turn down your volume when launching the Wii U version or your ears will be blasted. The Wii U version only released in Japan, so you will need a Japanese Wii U or a softmodded Wii U to play the game... or you could just get it on another platform like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PS4 and PC.</p>

                        <p>The Lego Movie Videogame for the 3DS is a weird game. Instead of being a regular Travelers Tales Lego game, it's completly different, where you literally cannot jump. What the fuck bro. Why DOESNT my lego man JUMP!??!?!? Anyways, you only have 1 life on a level. If you die, you have to restart the level, which SUCKS. This game was really unforgiving for young me and now it made me hate it so since I'm biased... You get the idea. Please just play the console version.</p>

                        <p>YO-KAI WATCH 3 is currently the last game in the mainline series outside of Asia. It's a very long game, with a LOT of content. Even when you finish it, there's still a lot more stuff you can do! This game also switches up the battle system from the previous games. Instead of having a wheel you have to spin around to change where your Yo-Kai are on the battle field, it's now grid-based. You move the Yo-Kai medals to where you want them to be, and bam! After 1 "turn", they move there. You can also dodge Yo-Kai soultimates using the grid. In previous games, it would simply be an unavoidable attack if you didn't cancel it. The game's dialoge is pretty funny, and at the start of the game I love the moment where everyone is speaking in some yankee accent and the main character (Nate) is hella confused on what they're saying. I liked this game a LOT. I put around 35 hours into this game, which I think is the most I've ever put into for an RPG game.</p>

                        <p>Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil is so fucking good. Literally. I'm not joking. I can't believe I put off playing this game until I got a copy of the PS2 version, and oh my god, this game is a masterpiece. Klonoa 2's controls and gameplay is close to the first game, dare I say 1:1. This doesn't mean it's just the same stuff again, but "2", Klonoa 2 adds in new elements and stage gimmicks that I find so awesome, such as the launcher cannon things and the bosses. The levels that stood out the most for me were "Maze of Memories" and "Hyuponia". The game's soundtrack is just so damn good I listen to it in my free time. I also like how Klonoa seems to have learned from his past. I would recommend playing the PS2 version if you can first because it's a lot less jank than the remake, however if you don't mind it, or you need easy mode and speeding up cutscenes, play the remake instead. Overall, I think Klonoa 2 is a fantastic sequel to Klonoa 1, and I can't wait for more. It's a shame Klonoa is still lesser-known, as literally every mainline game that has come out of the Klonoa franchise is extremely good.</p>

                        <h4>Software Creations</h4>
                        <p>Mario Artist: Paint Studio is the sequel to SNES's Mario Paint. What's new in this tool however is well... too much to mention here! With the 64DD diskette's save size, you can save lots, and I mean lots, of drawings! You can also make animations now, and there's a lot of stamps you can use to add to your picture too. I love drawing something nice and then ruining it with some stamps of Mario & others. There's also a 3D world where you can explore around, take pictures of things that you can draw on later and also edit the texture of some objects (I turned a dolphin's texture into Mario). There's also multiplayer, but it's heavily limited in what you can do, however you can grief your friend's drawing at any time by clicking the Rocket. However, this game is not that easy to draw with without an N64 mouse, so using one is basically recommended if you want to have more fine control. Oh, and I forgot to mention: you can use pictures taken with the Game Boy Camera and the Capture Pak. However, there's no Gnat Attack, unfortunately. Mario Artist: Paint Studio is a really good game, but I wish there was more you could do.</p>

                        <p>Mario Artist: Talent Studio is one of the most fun character creator tool I've ever used before. In this tool, you can make your own character (called "Talents"), and you can watch them dance in "Show Time" or make your own movies. The talent customisation is very intricate, with the ability to even use a picture you have taken with the Game Boy Camera, Capture Pak or any drawings you made in Mario Artist: Paint Studio as a face, texture for clothing, and more! You can also give your character a voice using the Capture Pak as well. The movie editor may take a while to learn but is fun to master, and the sample movies included are very unique and bizzare. You can even import 3D models made in Mario Artist: Polygon Studio as objects in your movie too! There's also a gallery where you can show off your movies and talents. The music for this game is really, really good too. Mario Artist: Talent Studio is an amazing tool and hopefully it (along with the other 64DD titles) gets re-released some day on Nintendo Classics, especially with the Nintendo Switch 2 having a mouse mode..</p>

                        <h4>Nichimen Graphics</h4>
                        <p>Mario Artist: Polygon Studio is the last game in the Mario Artist series (not counting Mario Artist: Communication Kit). I was suprised at how simple to use the model creator is, and I actually preferred using it over any other 3D modeling tool I've ever used. The model creator lets you use simple shapes such as a cube as a base (Blender users HATE the CUBE!!) and some other objects to start with if you're not feeling like making a model such as Mario himself or the N64 controller. Once you've inserted a base you can pretty much manipulate every point of the model and go wild, add more vertecies and faces (until you hit the polygon limit). You can paint onto your model with ease, with some pre-made stamps; However, if you decide to edit the model after painting you lose all of the paint, most likely due to hardware limitations. That's not all however. There's an entirely seperate creator where you can add machine parts to your model such as legs, a mouth that speaks, wheels, and many more you can unlock in the semi-open world called the "Experimental World" by going up to toasters and speaking to sentient toast... yeah. There's a lot you can do in this tool, and as mentioned earlier you can put the Polygon Studio diskette into Talent Studio and use your models in the movie editor. You can also make a set with all your model creations, take a picture and use it in Paint Studio to draw over. The interconnectivity of all these tools is really cool. Finally, there's two minigames, one called Boom Beat and the other called Go-Go Park. Boom Beat is a precursor to WarioWare Inc and is very challenging to get a high score on, while Go-Go Park is a weird minigame where you have to wind up your creation and send it flying to reach the "safe" zone, otherwise it will EXPLODE to smithereens if you don't reach it or fly off the edge if you charged up too much. Overall, Mario Artist: Polygon Studio was a tool I had a lot of fun with.</p>

                        <p>F-Zero X Expansion Kit is pretty much DLC before DLC was really feasable. There's 12 new tracks, it adds an in-depth track editor to the game (apparently it is pretty much the same the developers used to make the tracks in the game). I had a lot of fun making really dumb tracks that you can die easily on. There's a car editor but I didn't really use it as I stick to just the default. It also adds stereo music and some new music tracks, such as a really good remix of Mario Kart 64's Rainbow Road. You can now save time trial ghosts onto the diskette instead of a Controller Pak, which is a really nice feature because my (bootleg) Controller Pak isn't working anymore. One extra thing you can also do is use the Expansion Kit diskette with Mario Artist: Paint studio, and you'll get some images of F-Zero X renders you can use in your artwork. Overall I had a lot of fun with this and adds on to F-Zero X in a good way.</p>

                        <h4>Margarite Entertainment</h4>
                        <p>Never in my life would I expect Big Rigs to be re-released, but here it is. It's the original game with free DLC featuring some new vehicles and maps... and that's about it. There's now a launcher as well for some reason. The steam achievements are just spam and you don't even gain them for being a Winner, you just have to leave the launcher running and do nothing. Also, you can edit every text label in the launcher. The developers should have at least added some proper widescreen support and proper steamworks integration without the really hacky methods they used, but hey, this is Big Rigs we're talking about after all. As the AVGN would put it... This game is AAAAAAAASSSSS! I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you really love shovelware games and playing a game that lets you go under -1000kph, or its on sale for like $1 and you have nothing else to do... or you could just play the original game. At least they didn't patch the infinite negative speed glitch.</p>
